INFO

Experimental "web server" that acceps PUT-requests with JavaScript code as content.
The server evaluates the JavaScript code using the Rhino engine.

HOW TO

Modify local.properties to point to your Android SDK, alter this line:
sdk.dir=/Users/miki/android/android-sdk-mac

Compile and upload to emulator/device with the command:
ant install

To evaluate code, you must send it to the device using an HTP PUT request.
There is a Squeak workspace that does this. Do as follows:
1) Download Squeak from: http://www.squeak.org
2) Open the Squeak image
3) Left click on the background, select open/file list, then file in
the file squeak/Android-Workspace.st
4) Select open/workspace in the background menu, then type:
AndroidWorkspace new open
Then select the text with the mouse then right click (or middle click) and select do it in the menu
You now have a workspace to type in JavaScript code and evaluate with right/middle click Run on Android
5) Make sure the RhinoDroidServer is running on the emulator
6) Create a port forwarding using the commands that are found at the start of the file 
squeak/Android Workspace.text
7) Type in some java script code and run it!

THE BROWSER

There is also a JavaScript browser in class RhinoDroidBrowser. Edit AndroidManifest.xml to compile 
the browser. Then upload the file javascript/Hello.js to the device/emulator and open it in the app. 
The browser allows code to be loaded from a file, either locally or over http (has not been tested yet).
Note that there is an open method in the activity that can be used to open another JavaScript file.
More examples will be provided. There may be security concerns, but it is really promising to have
a browser that allows for loading lightweight app code over the network. Welcome to the html-less
web for Android, runing JavaScript!

Have fun!
