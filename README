HOW TO

Modify local.properties to point to your Android SDK, alter this line:
sdk.dir=/Users/miki/android/android-sdk-mac

Compile and upload to emulator/device with the command:
ant install

To evaluate code, you must send it to the device using an HTP PUT request.
There is a Squeak workspace that does this. Do as follows:
1) Download Squeak from: http://www.squeak.org
2) Open the Squeak image
3) Left click on the background, select open/file list, then file in
the file squeak/Android-Workspace.st
4) Select open/workspace in the background menu, then type:
AndroidWorkspace new open
Then select the text with the mouse then right click (or middle click) and select do it in the menu
You now have a workspace to type in JavaScript code and evaluate with right/middle click Run on Android
5) Make sure the RhinoDroidServer is running on the emulator
6) Create a port forwarding using the commands that are found at the start of the file 
squeak/Android Workspace.text
7) Type in some java script code and run it!

A JavaScript browser will also be added to RhinoDroid that allows code to be loaded from a file,
either locally or over http.

Have fun!
