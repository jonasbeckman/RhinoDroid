HOW TO USE THE JAVASCRIPT BROWSER

There is also a JavaScript browser in class RhinoDroidBrowser. Edit AndroidManifest.xml to compile 
the browser. Then upload the file javascript/Hello.js to the device/emulator and open it in the app. 
The browser allows code to be loaded from a file, either locally or over http (has not been tested yet).
Note that there is an open method in the activity that can be used to open another JavaScript file.
More examples will be provided. There may be security concerns, but it is really promising to have
a browser that allows for loading lightweight app code over the network. Welcome to the html-less
web for Android, runing JavaScript!
